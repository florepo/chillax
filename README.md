# chillax

chillax is a lightweight, open-source single-page application built by Tish Chungoora and Florian Stagliano. The app was conceived for users to create personalised soundscapes using sound snippets available from a library of sounds. The app was built within a one-week timescale using a tech stack consisting of Rails API, Ruby, Postgres, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## Motivation

- We wanted to showcase an app built using Rails backend and JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend.
- We believe in the balance between working hard and taking time out to recharge as a key for staying productive and agile in a software development environment.
- We aimed to go beyond our the learnings from our curriculum by incorporating audio manipulation and Bootstrap CSS styling.

## Stack

- Rails and Progres for backend
- JavaScript, HTML5 Audio and Bootstrap for frontend
